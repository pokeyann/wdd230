    <h3>Netflix</h3>

    <img src="images/netflix.png" alt="netflix">
    <p>Netflix uses the Z pattern design, easily drawing the user to the call to action - Get Started. The focused
      color pallette of red and white along with the simple layout work well.  Even though the background image could
      be considered "busy", the use of contrast and typography help the words stand out and easy to read. I was suprised to 
      see 5 different fonts, they are seemlessly used. They have created a unique style that creates a brand easily 
      recognizable.

  <h3>Amazon - Buy Again</h3>
  <h4><a href="https://www.amazon.com/">amazon.com</a></h4>
  <img src="images/amazon.png" alt="amazon">
  <p>On the buy again section the images are shown in a simple and clean way.  Within two clicks the item is in your
    cart. On the first click a list of previously purchased items is shown in the same simple and clean way.  From there
    only one click is required to add to cart.

  <p>I love google, and have since day one.  I will forever love google because of them I have been able to run fast 
    and far from the chaos that was the late 90's Yahoo.  Google is king when it comes to white space and clean design.
    Their simplicity was a breath of fresh air that I'm still enjoying today.  They led us into the bliss that is 
    simplicity online.
