      <h3>Netflix</h3>
      <h4><a href="https://www.netflix.com/">netflix.com</a></h4>
      <img src="images/netflix.png" alt="netflix">
      <p>Netflix uses the Z pattern design, easily drawing the user to the call to action - Get Started. The focused
        color pallette of red and white along with the simple layout work well. Even though the background image could
        be considered "busy", the use of contrast and typography help the words stand out and easy to read. I was
        suprised to
        see 5 different fonts, they are seemlessly used. They have created a unique style that creates a brand easily
        recognizable.

      <h3>Amazon - Buy Again</h3>
      <h4><a href="https://www.amazon.com/">amazon.com</a></h4>
      <img src="images/amazon.png" alt="amazon">
      <p>On the buy again section the images are shown in a simple and clean way. Within two clicks the item is in your
        cart. On the first click a list of previously purchased items is shown in the same simple and clean way. From
        there
        only one click is required to add to cart.

      <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
      <h3>Google</h3>
      <h4><a href="https://www.google.com/">google.com</a></h4>
      <img src="images/google.png" alt="google">
      <p>I love google, and have since day one. I will forever love google because of them I have been able to run fast
        and far from the chaos that was the late 90's Yahoo. Google is king when it comes to white space and clean
        design.
        Their simplicity was a breath of fresh air that I'm still enjoying today. They led us into the bliss that is
        simplicity online.
